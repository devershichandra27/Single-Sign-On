# Single-Sign-On
A simple django program to demonstrate single sign on<br>
<br>
This project allows user to register and sign-in to the web app.<br>
The user is redirected to App-1 after signing in.<br>
There are two web apps namely app-1 and app-2. (Just two webpages.... I call 'em apps :-p). <br>
I haven't used any standards while implementing it.
<br>
To run the process run the command <br>
$ python manage.py runserver <br>
on your terminal window
and browse to location <br>
<br>
127.0.0.1:8000/chat/<br>
<br>
Address of app-1: 127.0.0.1:8000/chat/app1/<br>
address of app-2: 127.0.0.1:8000/chat/app2/<br>
